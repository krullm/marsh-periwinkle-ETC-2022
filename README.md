# marsh-periwinkle-ET&C-2022
Dataset from the manuscript "Joint effects of fragmentation and mercury contamination on marsh periwinkle (Littoraria irrorata) movement" published at Environmental toxicology and Chemistry in 2022. 

The dataset consists of the position of each snail (x and y axis), displacement in each step, level of cover, snail ID, the exposed Hg concentration and the turning angle in a given time. Please notice that this is the raw data without applying the Savitzkyâ€“Golay filter as described in the manuscript.


The data of each snail is also provided in the csv file "Single snail data.csv".

Please contact krull@zalf.de if you have any questions.
